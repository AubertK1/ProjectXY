This is the code I use for making the buttons and labels

		//First create a group (it houses all the actors so that they can be setup on the screen together and drawn together)
		Group group = new Group();
		//Then set its position on the screen
		group.setPosition(Gdx.graphics.getWidth()/2f, 200);
		//next make an actor. Each actor has different parameters but all of them will ask for the skin. Just put skin

This is for labels:
        //first create the Label
		Label tempLabel = new Label("This is an actor", skin);
		//then set its size/position (the position is relative to the position of the group)
		tempLabel.setPosition(0, 200);
This is for buttons:
		//buttons are usually final, so you can reference it in a listener
		final TextButton tempButton2 = new TextButton("so is the button below this (CLICK IT)",skin);
		tempButton2.setPosition(0, tempLabel.getY()-tempButton2.getHeight());

		final Button tempButton = new Button(skin);
		//listeners tell the button what to do after you click it
		tempButton.addListener(new ClickListener(){
			public void clicked (InputEvent event, float x, float y) {
				tempButton2.setText("You clicked the button below me !!");
			}
		});
		//setting size and position
		tempButton.setSize(150, 30);
		tempButton.setPosition(0, tempButton2.getY()-tempButton.getHeight());

Once you are done:
		//after you make an actor, add it to the group
		group.addActor(tempLabel);
		group.addActor(tempButton2);
		group.addActor(tempButton);

		//then add the group to the stage and that's it
		stage.addActor(group);
